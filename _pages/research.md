# Overview

I been working on the mathematical foundations of algorithms in 3-D computer vision and 3-D computational imaging. Recently my research has focused on Structure from Motion and Cryo-Electron Microscopy Imaging, which respectively asks to recover the 3-D structure of stationary scenes (e.g. Eiffel Tower) and macromolecules (e.g. Covid-19 spike protein) from their 2-D images. In these fields, I aim to develop explainable algorithms that are robust to corrupted and noisy data and scalable to modern large real datasets, by leveraging advanced tools in computational geometry, algebra, statistics, signal processing and nonlinear optimization.
