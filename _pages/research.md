I been working on the mathematical foundations of algorithms in **3-D computer vision** and **3-D computational imaging**. Recently my research has focused on **Structure from Motion** and **Cryo-Electron Microscopy Imaging**, which respectively asks to recover the 3-D structure of stationary scenes (e.g. Eiffel Tower) and macromolecules (e.g. Covid-19 spike protein) from their 2-D images. In these fields, I aim to develop fast and explainable algorithms that are robust to corrupted and noisy data, by leveraging advanced tools in computational geometry, algebra, statistics, signal processing and nonlinear optimization.
