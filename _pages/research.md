I have been working on the mathematical foundations of algorithms in **3-D computer vision** and **3-D computational imaging**. Recently my research has focused on **Structure from Motion** and **Cryo-Electron Microscopy Imaging**, which respectively asks to recover the 3-D structure of stationary scenes (e.g. Eiffel Tower) and macromolecules (e.g. Covid-19 spike protein) from their 2-D images. In these fields, I aim to develop fast and explainable algorithms that are robust to corrupted and noisy data, by leveraging advanced tools in computational geometry, algebra, statistics, signal processing and nonlinear optimization.

For prospective students, here is a list of courses that are relevant to my research:
MAT 226: Numerical Methods
MAT 235: Probability Theory
MAT 258: Numerical Optimization
MAT 270: Mathematics of Data Science
MAT 271: Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis
STA 231: Mathematical Statistics
ECS 174: Computer Vision
ECS 231: Large-Scale Scientific Computation
EEC 206: Digital Image Processing
EEC 264: Estimation and Detection of Signals in Noise.
