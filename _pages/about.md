# About Me

* I am a postdoctral research associate in the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM) at Princeton University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Minnesota under the supervision of Prof. Gilad Lerman. 

* My research interests include 3D computer vision, robust estimation, nonconvex optimization and high dimensional statistics. In particular, I have been working on structure from motion (SfM) and its associated inverse problems. These inverse problems typically involve synchronization over a space with specified algebraic structure (e.g. groups), which has broad applications in 3D reconstruction, multi-object matching, commnuity detection and ranking. My current research primarily focuses on the mathematical problems that arise from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging, which aims to recover the 3D structure of macromolecules from their  noisy 2D images.
