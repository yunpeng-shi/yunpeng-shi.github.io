# About Me

* I am an assistant professor in mathematics at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/) since Fall 2023.
* I was a postdoctoral research associate in the [Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) (PACM) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/) from 2020 to 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from [University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Gilad Lerman](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/). 
* I am actively seeking Ph.D. students. If you are interested in working with me, please send your CV to ypshi at ucdavis dot edu.

# Research Interests
* 3D Computer Vision & Image Processing
* Cryo-electron Microscopy Imaging (3D Imaging for Protein Molecules)
* Robust Estimation & Outlier Detection
* Scalable Computational Methods
* Nonlinear Dimension Reduction & Manifold Learning
* Optimal Transport

<!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of robust estimation, nonconvex optimization, computational methods and statistics, and their applications to a variety of inverse problems in 3-D reconstruction. One particular problem I am interested in is robust group synchronization, which involves synchronization over a space with certain algebraic structure (e.g. groups), under high corruption of data. It has broad applications in 3-D reconstruction, graph matching, image alignment, community detection, phase retrieval and ranking. My current research primarily focuses on the mathematical problems that arise from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging, which aims to recover the 3-D structure of macromolecules from their highly noisy 2-D images. I have been working on high performance methods (high speed and accuracy) for covariance estimation, contrast estimation, deconvolution, unsupervised denoising of cryo-EM images. -->

# News
* Mar 2025: Our paper on [sliced-Wasserstein-based image alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13756v1) is posted online. It is the first OT-based alignment method that achieves $O(L^2\log L)$ complexity for $L\times L$ images, which matches the that of the Euclidean-based methods. Code available at [https://github.com/EricVerbeke/fast_image_alignment_ot](https://github.com/EricVerbeke/fast_image_alignment_ot).
* Feb 2024: Our new paper on the distributed group synchronization is accepted to [CVPR 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024).
* Nov 2022: I will be organizing the minisymposium "Problems and Solutions of 3-D Reconstruction" at [2023 SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/cse23) at Amsterdam, Netherland.
* Nov 2022: Our code for fast principal component analysis of cryo-EM images is released at [https://github.com/yunpeng-shi/fast-cryoEM-PCA](https://github.com/yunpeng-shi/fast-cryoEM-PCA) and will be merged into [ASPIRE-python](https://github.com/ComputationalCryoEM/ASPIRE-Python) for single particle reconstruction.
