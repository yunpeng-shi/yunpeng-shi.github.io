# About Me

* I am a postdoctral research associate in the [Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) (PACM) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from [University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Gilad Lerman](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/). 
* I will be joining the math department at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/) as an assistant professor in Fall 2023.

# Research Interests
* Machine Learning 
* Mathematics of Data Science
* Robust Estimation
* Scalable Computation Methods
* 3-D Computer Vision
* Cryo-electron Microscopy Imaging

<!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of robust estimation, nonconvex optimization, computational methods and statistics, and their applications to a variety of inverse problems in 3-D reconstruction. One particular problem I am interested in is robust group synchronization, which involves synchronization over a space with certain algebraic structure (e.g. groups), under high corruption of data. It has broad applications in 3-D reconstruction, graph matching, image alignment, community detection, phase retrieval and ranking. My current research primarily focuses on the mathematical problems that arise from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging, which aims to recover the 3-D structure of macromolecules from their highly noisy 2-D images. I have been working on high performance methods (high speed and accuracy) for covariance estimation, contrast estimation, deconvolution, unsupervised denoising of cryo-EM images. -->
