# About Me

* I am a postdoctral research associate in the [Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) (PACM) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Gilad Lerman](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/). 

* My research interests include 3D computer vision, robust estimation, nonconvex optimization and high dimensional statistics. In particular, I have been working on structure from motion (SfM) and its associated inverse problems. These inverse problems typically involve synchronization over a space with certain algebraic structure (e.g. groups), which has broad applications in 3D reconstruction, multi-object matching, commnuity detection and ranking. My current research primarily focuses on the mathematical problems that arise from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging, which aims to recover the 3D structure of macromolecules from their  noisy 2D images.
