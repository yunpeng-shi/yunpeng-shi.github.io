# About Me

* I am a postdoctral research associate in the [Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) (PACM) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from [University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Gilad Lerman](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/).  

* My research interests lie at the intersection of robust estimation, nonconvex optimization, computational methods and statistics, and their applications to a variety of inverse problems in 3-D reconstruction. One particular problem I am interested in is robust group synchronization, which involves synchronization over a space with certain algebraic structure (e.g. groups), under high corruption of data. It has broad applications in 3D reconstruction, graph matching, image alignment, commnuity detection, phase retrieval and ranking. My current research primarily focuses on the mathematical problems that arise from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging, which aims to recover the 3D structure of macromolecules from their highly noisy 2D images. I have been working on high performance method (high speed and accuracy) for covariance estimation, contrast estimation, CTF correction, unsupervised denoising of cryo-EM imagess.
