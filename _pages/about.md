I am a postdoctral research associate in the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM) at Princeton University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Minnesota under the supervision of Prof. Gilad Lerman. 

My research interests include 3D computer vision, robust estimation, nonconvex optimization and high dimensional statistics. In particular, I have been working on structure from motion (SfM) and its associated inverse problems. These inverse problems typically involve synchronization over a space with specified algebraic structure (e.g. groups), which has broad applications in 3D reconstruction, multi-object matching, commnuity detection and ranking. My current research focuses on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging that aims to recover the 3D structure of macromolecules from their super noisy 2D images.
