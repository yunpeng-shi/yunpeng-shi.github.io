## Abstract
We propose an efficient and robust iterative solution to the multi-object matching problem. We first
clarify serious limitations of current methods as well as the inappropriateness of the standard iteratively
reweighted least squares procedure. In view of these limitations, we propose a novel and more reliable
iterative reweighting strategy that incorporates information from higher-order neighborhoods by
exploiting the graph connection Laplacian. We demonstrate the superior performance of our procedure
over state-of-the-art methods using both synthetic and real datasets.
