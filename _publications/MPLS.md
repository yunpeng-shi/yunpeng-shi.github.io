## Abstract
We propose an efficient algorithm for solving group synchronization under high levels of corruption and
noise, while we focus on rotation synchronization. We
first describe our recent theoretically guaranteed message passing algorithm that estimates the corruption
levels of the measured group ratios. We then propose a
novel reweighted least squares method to estimate the
group elements, where the weights are initialized and
iteratively updated using the estimated corruption levels. We demonstrate the superior performance of our
algorithm over state-of-the-art methods for rotation
synchronization using both synthetic and real data.
